This project initializes a front-end application with React deployed with Surge.

Its purpose is to integrate the Spotify API that allows access to their database's music, tracks, and playlists.

This application allows users to add, eliminate, and update tracks and playlists on demand to their Spotify account.

It serves as an example of what React can do in the front end. It served as a milestone learning project to learn the reactive thinking of the framework and practice my skills.

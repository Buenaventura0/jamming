This project initializes a front-end application with React deployed with Surge.

Its purpose is to integrate the Spotify API that allows access to music, tracks and playlists of their database.

A user can add, eliminate and update tracks and playlists on demand to their Spotify account using this application.

It serves as an example of what React can do in the front-end. It served me as a milestone learning project to learn the reactive thinking of the framework and practice my skills.
